## Objectives of this report

The following report combines Covid-19 data alongside key economic data, social sentiment data and asset price data from various data sources to test a number of questions surrounding the impacts of Covid-19 globally. The report will answer the following questions:
 * Is the increase in Covid-19 cases correlated with greed in the cryptocurrency market and stockmarket?
 * Has Covid-19 impacted per capita GDP growth and inflation?
 * What are the top ten nations with the most Covid-19 cases? Do these same countries feature in the top 10 nations with the highest economic growth? 
 * Are future predictions of various cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) aligned to predictions against the S & P 500 stockmarket index?
